Instructions and notes:

Be sure you have accessed each remote host at least once from the machine you're 
using to host the backups, run the host-exec.sh script manually the first time.
This is to ensure that you don't get hung up on the RSA key verifications.

If you are having issues with an ongoing verification request, check your 
known.hosts file to make sure you're not dealing with duplicate entries, for
example an entry by ip address and another by hostname. This sounds redundant
but happens quite often in this environment.
