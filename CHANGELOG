CHANGELOG

2015-12-01

Changed the entware installation routine to go directly to the entware install
    tools, allowing for a straight install of the latest entware without the 
    two-step install/upgrade previously used.

Identified a "miss" (bug) where remote_exec.sh doesn't trap whether we're
    running in a router or a *nix environment. It probably doesn't hurt anything
    but the error messages aren't pretty, and since remote_exec.sh is setup to
    run more-or-less "blind" it should trap and fail outside the router.

2015-11-22

Added logic to determine whether running from a router or some other *nix box,
    and adjust the ssh/rsh behavior accordingly.
    
Removed some loops from host-exec.sh, did away with the need to write/read a 
    temp file.
    
Added a re-check for writabiity in the backup storage directory. It was possible
    to spec an unwritable directory, and without trapping the error, continue
    to run the script while failing to save the backups locally. Now it will
    bail. Probably not ideal, but better than *thinking* you have a backup.
    
Updated the parsing of remotehosts file, allowing for the ability to "comment
    out" an entry, useful to temporarily disable a remote backup, or to use as
    a placeholder for a future node.
    
Minor updates to the syntax of the output of remote-exec.sh, and fixed some 
    comments in the script.
