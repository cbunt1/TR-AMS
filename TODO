Overcome Limiatations of Router/Firmware environment and zsh, preferably
    without adding more entware tools if at all possible.
    
1. Fix the the comment-parsing of the remotehosts file. (zsh limitation)
    Solution: No comments in remotehosts.
    Alternative: install bash as part of the opkg dependencies (not ideal)
    Preferred: find/develop a better parsing statement that works in zsh
    
2. ssh invocation doesn't work on a router environment at this point. Options:
    Solution: Install and use entware ssh (easiest, since doesn't require key
        conversions.
    Preferred: Update statement or add test to invoke dropbear for silent ssh
        Prerequisite: Back to confirmed login capability between boxes. Need to
        document the openssh/dropbear conversion process, espceially since it
        doesn't appear the native dropbear tool can make the conversion onboard.
